# Fuel consumption API

The fuel consumption API keeps track of vehicle fuel usage.

For each vehicle it stores: 

* the total distance travel
* the total fuel entered

The API can calculate how much kilometers a car can travel per 1 liter of petrol based on the fuel entered and the distance traveled.

## API end points

## What you need to build

Use the API to build:

* A screen that list all the cars - showing a mileage, total fuel consumption.
* A screen where a new car can be added.
* A screen where fuel can be added for a selected car

Add support to filter cars based on mileage and fuel consumption (kilometers per litre).
